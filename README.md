# Kendryte SDK demo code fixes for Sipeed M1W
I recently tried using Kendryte Standalone and freertos sdk on Sipeed m1w board.
Unfortunately basic demos like lcd does not work properly or at all(probably wrong
driver?). I am trying to fix the codes by copying code snippets from working codes
(MaixPy source for example).
